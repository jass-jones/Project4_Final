        <h1>Spotify Charting Predictions</h1>
        <p>Use the sliders below to predict the success of your song on Spotify</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <form action="{{ url_for('predict')}}"method="post">
        <h2>Popularity</h2>
        <p>Popularity of the song, 100 being the most popular.</p>
        <p>Enter value between: 0 and 100</p>
        <input type="text" name="popularity" placeholder="Popularity" required="required" />
        <h2>Acousticness</h2>
        <p>Acousticness refers to not using electrical amplification of musical instruments. A score of 1 is indicative of a song played entirely on acoustic instruments.</p>
        <p>Enter value between: 0 and 1</p>
        <input type="text" name="acousticness" placeholder="Acousticness" required="required" />
        <h2>Danceability</h2>
        <p>Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.</p>
        <p>Enter value between: 0 and 1</p>
        <input type="text" name="danceability" placeholder="Danceability" required="required" />
        <h2>Energy</h2>
        <p>Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.</p>
        <p>Enter value between: 0 and 1</p>
		<input type="text" name="energy" placeholder="Energy" required="required" />
        <h2>Duration</h2>
        <p>Duration of the track in milliseconds.</p>
        <p>Enter value between: 0 and 3600000</p>
        <input type="text" name="duration_ms" placeholder="Duration (ms)" required="required" />
        <h2>Liveness</h2>
        <p>Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.</p>
        <p>Enter value between: 0 and 1</p>
        <input type="text" name="liveness" placeholder="Liveness" required="required" />
        <h2>Loudness</h2>
        <p>The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.</p>
        <p>Enter value between:-60 and 5</p>
        <input type="text" name="loudness" placeholder="Loudness" required="required" />
        <h2>Speechiness</h2>
        <p>Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.</p>
        <p>Enter value between: 0 and 1</p>
		<input type="text" name="speechiness" placeholder="Speechiness" required="required" />
        <h2>Tempo</h2>
        <p>Beats per minute</p>
        <p>Enter value between: 0 and 400</p>
		<input type="text" name="tempo" placeholder="Tempo" required="required" />
        <h2>Valence</h2>
        <p>A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).</p>
        <p>Enter value between: 0 and 1</p>
		<input type="text" name="valence" placeholder="Valence" required="required" />
